# icard

A virtual payment solution developed during inCode 2023 Hackathon.

## Theme : Ideal Ride Hailing

What the ideal ride-hailing service should look like.

Analyze your experience of city rides, traveling between cities, or delivering goods.

Think about what you are missing, come up with the perfect service, and implement your idea at our hackathon.
